# 📊 Superstore Sales Data Analysis and Dashboard

## 📁 Project Overview

This project involves data analysis and dashboard creation based on the **Superstore Sales Dataset**. The goal is to extract actionable insights about sales performance, customer segments, regional profitability, and product trends. The process includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA) using **Jupyter Notebook**, and interactive dashboard development using **Power BI**.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

* **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)

  * Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
* **Power BI** for dashboard visualization
* **Microsoft Excel** (optional, for CSV formatting)

---

## 📌 Objectives

* Clean and preprocess the Superstore dataset for analysis.
* Perform EDA to uncover patterns and trends.
* Build visualizations to understand:

  * Sales & profit by region and category
  * Customer segmentation
  * Top-performing products and sub-categories
  * Shipping performance and delivery trends
* Create a professional Power BI dashboard for interactive data exploration.

## 📊 Dashboard Features (Power BI)

* **Sales Overview**: Total sales, profit, and quantity sold
* **Geographical Analysis**: Region-wise sales and profitability
* **Category Insights**: Performance of product categories and sub-categories
* **Customer Segmentation**: By region and profitability
* **Trend Analysis**: Monthly sales and profit trends
* **Shipping Analysis**: Shipping mode and delivery impact on sales

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & EDA Highlights

* Handled missing values and duplicates
* Corrected data types (dates, categorical variables)
* Created new columns (e.g., profit margin)
* Visualized correlations and distribution patterns
* Identified top customers and loss-generating segments

---

## 📈 Insights Gained

* Certain sub-categories like **Tables** and **Bookcases** consistently result in losses.
* **West and East regions** have high sales but varied profitability.
* **Same Day shipping** impacts profit margins negatively.
* Customer concentration is high in a few states — potential for market expansion.
